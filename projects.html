            <h2><a href="https://github.com/jaysprogram/CoinSum">Automatic Coin Counter</a></h2>
            <p>This mobile app was made using React-Native and Expo Camera. YOLOv11 was used to implement object detection for detecting different coins</br>
               and classifying them. It was trained using a US coing dataset in a variety of different settings in order to produce the best results.</br>
               In order to connect the model to the frontend for getting the number of coins in the image, a proxy server was set up using Flask, which</br>
               allowed the frontend in React-Native to communicate with the model written in Python.</br></p>

            <h2><a href="https://linguistify.co">Linguistify.co</a></h2>
            <p>This web app uses the power of AI to help new language learners feel more confident in their ability to pronounce new languages</br>
               and connects people through the power of conversation. The backend was implemented in two parts: speech pronunciation assessment and</br>
               speech pronunciation feedback. The speech pronunciation assessment was done using Microsoft Azure's Speech SDK and the results produced</br>
               by the pronunciation assessment API were fed into the Groq API, which allowed us to leverage Groq's efficient LLMs to get feeback quickly.</br>
               The frontend was created using Streamlit and the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API was used to provide audio references for users. A docker</br>
               image was then deployed to a container on Google Cloud, where it is currently hosted, allowing for PC and mobile use on the web.</br></p>

            <p>Trained using the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) Dataset, this model improves upon a baseline by generating</br>
               images of real human beings that have less deformaties and static than those produced by the baseline model. This Generative</br>
               Adversarial Network (GAN) was made with a focus on finetuning the hyperparameters in order to show how improving the hyperparameters</br>
               could make a drastic difference in how a model performs, even when given the slightest of changes.</br></p>

            <p>Developed using Java and Python, this app allows the user to reformat images to fit a certain perspective. JavaFX was used</br>
               to build the front end and OpenCV and Numpy was utilized to create the algorithm that rectifies the given input image.</br></p>

            <p>As the backend developer, I integrated account and article creation and editing, login functionality, and image uploading</br>
               utilizing MongoDB. Furthermore, I employed Node.js to handle API calls and backend tasks through a local server and devised</br>
               and deployed a method to concurrently run both the client and the server. Svelte was also used to create a user interface</br>
               that allowed both users and developers the make use of these backend services.</br></p>

            <p>As the team lead and full-stack developer, I oversaw the development of ShuffleBite, which was created using React-Native,</br>
               JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and BootStrap and utilizes the Yelp API to fetch restaurant information. Node.js was also applied to</br>
               implement a proxy server used by the website for API calls.</br></p>

            <p>Using a Raspberry Pi Pico and a variety of sensors, I developed a line-following robot and reduced collisions by 50% by</br>
               implementing object detection. The entire program was made using Python and external libraries that allowed me to utilize</br>
               the hardware.</br></p>

            <p>This command line game was made using Python, a random word API, and a dictionary API. It improves upon previously</br>
               created word guessing games by introducing a wider variety of word choices with random lengths, which are all collected</br>
               from the random word API. The dictionary API is then used to verify inputs, bringing everything together to make a fun,</br>
               yet challenging, game that elevates the user experience.</p>
